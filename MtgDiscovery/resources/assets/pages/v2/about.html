    <p><h1>About This</h1></p>
    <p>I've been collecting Magic: The Gathering cards since 1994. I've tried a dozen different ways to track my collection.</p>
    <p>None have worked for me.</p>
    <p>This site is built with the entire of providing /me/ with a smooth way to enter and track my collection.</p>
    <p>You can use it too.</p>
    <p>I'll even look into adding features you'd like.</p>
    <p>There are, and will probably always be, limitations based on how /I/ use the site. This is, and I recognize, an unfortunate reality of the intent of this site - For Me.</p>
    <p>It's a hack job with core functionality implemented in 3 days. Treat it as such.</p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>Given all that, I hope you can find some use in it.</p>
    <p>I find it AMAZING, not because I built it; it's given me insight into MTG cards and sets that I had NO idea about. This has OPENED a world of MTG cards I was blind to... SO HAPPY!!!!</p>
    <p>It is how I fluidly interact with MTG. That's the whole point of the site.</p>
    <p>Not the original goal... no no. The original goal was to practice Kotlin for a new job. It became mostly javascript.
        I'll accept that though for the joy I'm getting using this site.</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p><h1>Couldn't Do Without</h1></p>
    <p><a href="https://mtgjson.com/">MTGJSON</a> is the reason this exists. They've done the data work that I've built on top of.</p>
