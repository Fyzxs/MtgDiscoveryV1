    <p><strong>Order</strong>
    <ul>

        Sorts the items in ascending order of the sort selection. This is default for card views.
        <li>Descending</li>
        Sorts the items in descending order of the sort selection. This is default for set views.
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Filter</strong></p>
    The "Set Name" and "Card Name" text box can be quickly gotten to by hitting "SHIFT" twice in quick succession.
    <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Collection Status</li>
                This shows for sets, and filters based on the collection status. Completed Sets, Partial Sets, Not Started Sets.
                <li>Set Name</li>
                Instead of using the browser search, the sets can be searched via partial patch of the name or set code.
            </ul>

            <ul>

                <li>Card Count</li>
                Allows filtering cards with a certain amount collected. Mostly useful to me for seeing cards I have none of.
                <li>Card Name</li>
                Filter cards down by partial match of the card name. This is useful when you have a few cards to enter and don't want to scroll.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Binder View
            <ul>
                <li>Pages</li>
                You can navigate around the pages of the virtual binder.
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>DANGER ZONE</strong><br>
        The danger zone is useful controls that aren't easy to undo. While it's not heavily populated, it's important to keep away from the other controls.
        <br>This is the only control group that starts collapsed.
        Currently there's just one control here.<br>
        <em>Add one of each visible</em><br>
        This will add 1 card of each visible card on the page.
        It's useful for known complete sets, or the binder view to add a full page.
        <br><br>
        Valuable controls... dangerous controls.

    <h2>Pages</h2>
    For any of the pages showing set or card boxes, if there is a collector id in the url, that users collection information will be included in the page.<br><br><br>
    <p><strong>Sets</strong><br>
        This page shows my definition of "sets". I look at sets as separate things I can collect.
        If I decide I'm collecting "X", what is it I ACTUALLY have to collect.
        More importantly, what am I NOT feeling I have to collect? That's how I split these out.
        This is why a set like Zendikar Rising has 19 different sets associated with it. Any one of those I could collect in "isolation".
        That's not entirely true. I have to start with the core set. Everything else is then an option. This might change via this site as I get close to the smaller sets.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Set Cards</strong><br>
        All of the cards for a single set.
        There's two standouts on this page for me.
        <br>Collector Summary<br>
        Under the set box is a summary of the set collected so far. And the approximate cost to complete it.
        <br>9 card pages<br>
        The way I collect cards is in 9 card binder pages, so I show it.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Binder View</strong><br>
        This displays the set as 9 cards at a time, corresponding to the 9 card sheets for binders.<br>
        The display like this has been super helpful for me while going through my collection to ensure I have all the cards and they are organized correctly.
        It also makes knowing what links to click to be redirected to a store for purchasing really easy.
        <br>
        A fun feature I added after some purchasing mistakes is non-owned cards will be transparent. When I binder cards, I put a non-set land in backwards.
        This makes a quick visual indicator the card is not there. The transparency showing the back of the card is because that's what I do.
        It helps me line up my actual binder page to the page on the screen.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Parent Set</strong><br>
        NOT YET IMPLEMENTED<br>
        The idea here is that how I define sets are associated with each other. This page will show you ALL of those cards, all at once.</br>
        I used it a little, and there was SOME value to it... but wasn't enough for me to re-implement in the re-write. I'm going to change how the
        sets are displayed to help me with this.</p>
